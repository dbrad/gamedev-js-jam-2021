## Adventure Mode flow
- Move / Actions
  - if we are in the exit room, change retreat to leave
- Complete Movements
- Get room's meta data for enemies, loot, and events
- If we have combat, resolve it first.
- If we have loot, add it to the player's counts / inventory
- Finally, if we have events, start shoving them in the global currentEvent variable and resolving them
  - Dialog?
  - Choices?
  - Boons?
  - Penalities?
- once all events are resolved go back to the move/action phase
