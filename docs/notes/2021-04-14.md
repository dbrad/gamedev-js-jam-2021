## Little Reflection Game
- Main character is a lone little reflection
- Reflections without a mirror lose themselves
- Short mission style gameplay
- Meta currency and progression
- Collect parts of mirrors to use toward upgrading / building mirrors
- Collect sand as currency
- Upgrade mirrors at the Mirror Smith

## What do the mirrors do for the player?
- Power level, but how?
- More HP / tries at something?

## Combat / Mission Styles?
- Keep in mind: No touch controls
- ARPG combat?
- Puzzler combat?
- Puzzle level solving?
- Puzzles + exploration?
  - Proc gen dungeons to explore?
  - Roguelike only move when player moves?
- Card / Deck based encounters? (Staying on brand?)
- Dice based encounters? (Staying on brand?)
  - Push your luck mechanic?
    - 1-4-24? 2-4-24?
    - Zombie Dice style?
- Turn based combat?
- Rock, paper, scissor combat?
- Gambling style encounters? (Luck be a landlord insp.)

## If I do proc-gen dungeons I need:
- Proc Gen System
- Tilemap System
- Lighting System or a screens system to prevent map bleed?
- Will this even perform well without tilemap image caching?

### Procgen Algo
 - Check and place?
 - Cellular automata?
 - Do I want dungeons or caves?
