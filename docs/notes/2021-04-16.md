Map = 9x8
Rooms = 11x7 tiles
99x56 = 5544

x * 11, y * 7
Build the room map
Generate a tilemap from that map
all walls with a floor below them pick a random brick texture
all other walls are black

iterate all floor tiles, % chance to pick a random stone pattern
Unseen rooms just render black
Seen rooms you've left behind have transparent black over them

get rooms that should be on screen
